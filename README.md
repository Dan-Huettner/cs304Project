# AMS Inventory System

AMS Inventory System was a term project for CPSC 304 (Database Design I), a course I completed at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in the Fall of 2014. It was developed by a team of four computer science students, of which I was the project manager.

AMS Inventory System was developed for Allegro Music Store (AMS), a fictitious music store. It facilitates the essential operations for the store, including inventory management, user management, transaction management, and general maintenance of the database.
