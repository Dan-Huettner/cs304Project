# AMS Inventory System

AMS Inventory System was a term project for CPSC 304 (Database Design I), a course that our team completed at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in the Fall of 2014. The team consisted of four computer science students, of which Daniel Huettner was the project manager.

AMS Inventory System was developed for Allegro Music Store (AMS), a fictitious music store. It facilitates the essential operations for the store, including inventory management, user management, transaction management, and general maintenance of the database.
